# MATLAB-tools
Small functions for MATLAB use.

Most of these functions are written to help me easily beautify output from other scripts or programs. The bin scattter function is designed to capture information from iterated system where the iterated coodinates are important (such as displaying attractors). The cumulative histogram function (which is really a cumulative distribution function at the moment) is for determining the scaling of different values in some final output. The histogram scaling function uses a similar method with more hard coded values (which should possibly be eliminated) to rescale data such that the cumulative distribution of the data is linear. The downsample function is just a simple averaging function use for antialiasing.
